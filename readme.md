# Kukka Clicker Server

wip...

## Development environment
Use node 14.
```zsh
npm install
npx sequelize-cli init
npm run dev
```
If you get error "Please install sqlite3 package manually",
try [this](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/11174#issuecomment-509974511).

If you have some other issues try [this](https://github.com/mapbox/node-pre-gyp/issues/477#issuecomment-689923448). Maybe `python` needs to mean python 2 or something.
